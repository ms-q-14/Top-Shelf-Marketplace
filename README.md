## Built With

Our marketplace app is built with the latest technologies, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for our users.

The app is built using a microservices architecture, which allows us to break down the system into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed independently. This enables us to scale and update different parts of the app separately, making the system more flexible and reliable.

We use Docker to containerize our microservices, which helps to ensure consistency and ease of deployment across different environments. Additionally, we use Nginx as a reverse proxy to distribute incoming traffic to our microservices and to enhance the security by providing the functionality of SSL termination and load balancing, providing improved performance and reliability.

We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. JWT's are stateless and allow us to securely transmit user information across different services. It ensures that only authorized users can access the protected parts of the app and that the data is tamper-proof. This means our users can have confidence in the security of their personal information when using our marketplace.

We also use the technologies below for the web-app development which enhances the user experience. With a focus on performance, scalability and security, we have built a fast, reliable and secure platform for our users to enjoy.

All these technologies and standards working together provides our app a secure and reliable marketplace that makes it easy to find and bid on collectibles from around the world.
